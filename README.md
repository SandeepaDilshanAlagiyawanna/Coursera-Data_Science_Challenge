# Coursera Data Science Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Data Science Coding Challenge repository! This coding challenge is designed to test your skills in a real-world scenario, providing an opportunity for CS & DS learners to showcase their abilities and compete for prizes and achievement badges.

## Overview

In this challenge, participants will engage with one of the most industry-relevant machine learning problems using a unique dataset. The focus is on predicting subscription churn in a video streaming service, a common challenge faced by companies with subscription-based models. The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify existing subscribers likely to continue their subscriptions for another month.

## Problem Statement

As a new data scientist at a video streaming company, your task is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting which subscribers are at the highest risk of churn. The provided dataset is a sample of subscriptions initiated in 2021, with snapshots taken before subscription cancellations. Cancellation reasons may vary, such as customers completing all desired content, being too busy, or finding a better-suited streaming service.

The company aims to understand the likelihood of each individual customer churning to allocate resources effectively and support customers. Participants are required to leverage their machine learning toolkit to address this challenge.

## Success Criteria

Success in this challenge is defined by achieving a success rate with a minimum pass mark of 75%. Participants can demonstrate their proficiency and compete for rewards such as complimentary access to select Data Science courses or the opportunity to receive an achievement badge on their Coursera Skills Profile, showcasing their performance to recruiters.

## Instructions

- Participants are encouraged to explore the dataset and implement machine learning techniques to predict subscription churn.
- Consider factors influencing churn and build a model that provides accurate predictions.
- Submissions will be evaluated based on their success rate and overall effectiveness in addressing the problem.

Enjoy the challenge, and best of luck!
